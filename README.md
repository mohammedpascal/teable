## Development

#### 1. Initialize

```sh
# Enabling the Help Management Package Manager
corepack enable

# Install project dependencies
pnpm install
```

#### 2. Select Database

we currently support `sqlite` (dev only) and `postgres`, you can switch between them by running the following command

```sh
make switch-db-mode
```

#### 3. Custom Environment Variables（Optional）

```sh
cd apps/nextjs-app
cp .env.development .env.development.local
```

#### 4. Run Dev Server

you just need to start backend, it will start next server for frontend automatically, file change will be auto reload

```sh
cd apps/nestjs-backend
pnpm dev
```

By default, the plugin development server is not started. To preview and develop plugins, run:
```sh
# build packages
pnpm build:packages

# start plugin development server
cd plugins
pnpm dev
```
This will start the plugin development server on port 3002.


## Why Teable?

No-code tools have significantly speed up how we get things done, allowing non-tech users to build amazing apps and changing the way many work and live. People like using spreadsheet-like UI to handle their data because it's easy, flexible, and great for team collaboration. They also prefer designing their app screens without being stuck with clunky templates.

Giving non-techy people the ability to create their software sounds exciting. But that's just the start:

- As businesses expand, their data needs intensify. No one wishes to hear that once their orders reach 100k, they'll outgrow their current interface. Yet, many no-code platforms falter at such scales.
- Most no-code platforms are cloud-based. This means your important data sits with the provider, and switching to another platform can be a headache.
- Sometimes, no-code tools can't do what you want because of their limitations, leaving users stuck.
- If a tool becomes essential, you'll eventually need some tech expertise. But developers often find these platforms tricky.
- Maintaining systems with complex setups can be hard for developers, especially if these aren't built using common software standards.
- Systems that don't use these standards might need revamping or replacing, costing more in the long run. It might even mean ditching the no-code route and going back to traditional coding.

#### What We Think the Future Of No-code Products Look Like

- An interface that anyone can use to build applications easily.
- Easy access to data, letting users grab, move, and reuse their information as they wish.
- Data privacy and choice, whether that's in the cloud, on-premise, or even just on your local.
- It needs to work for developers too, not just non-tech users.
- It should handle lots of data, so it can grow with your business.
- Flexibility to integrate with other software, combining strengths to get the job done.
- Last, native AI integration to takes usability to the next level.

In essence, Teable isn't just another no-code solution, it's a comprehensive answer to the evolving demands of modern software development, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their technical proficiency, has a platform tailored to their needs.
